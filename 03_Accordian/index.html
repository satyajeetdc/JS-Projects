            Myntra is an online marketplace platform that enables independent
            sellers to sell their products to buyers. The prices are solely
            decided by the sellers, and Myntra does not interfere in the same.
            There could be a possibility that the same product is sold by
            different sellers at different prices. Myntra rightfully fulfils all
            legal compliances of onboarding multiple sellers on its forum as it
            is a marketplace platform.
